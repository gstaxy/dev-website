This is my new website.

I've wanted to come up with an updated dev website for a while so here it is finally. This will serve as both a way to know more about me and also a place where I can write blogs around problems I solved as an engineer and thoughts around AI, science and research. 

All opinions and experiences that I will eventually share here are my own and not the ones of the organizations I publicly represent as either a founder or an employee.

This website is a fork from [Guillermo Rauch blog](https://github.com/rauchg/blog). I've always liked minimalist and thoughtfully crafted personal websites and I think this one represents my vision. I added a few pages and links to make it richer in terms of content and options.

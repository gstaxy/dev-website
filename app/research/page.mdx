# Research
My academic background shaped my vision of technology and the approach I have towards my projects. I learned incredibly valuable lessons through successes and failures during those years. 

1. **Agency** - From the minute you start a research project, you become the only one responsible for making it through. You will need to make difficult decisions, work with tight budgets, communicate with highly respected scientists, plan for the worst case scenarios, set ambitious goals (or making bold predictions), organize field work seasons in remote locations up to one year ahead, present your early work at international conferences, and finally publish your results in peer reviewed journals after tedious revisions. All of that with intention, for the love of science. 
2. **Leadership** - The opportunities to lead in academia are countless. As I went deep into advanced statistics, I was often requested by my MSc and PhD peers for guidance and mentorship, often in critical times. Coding and math are not well percieved in biology in general. It's considered a necessary evil that most would rather avoid than embrace. So I was there to put smiles on crying faces and lead the way for them to make statistics a friend rather than an enemy. I tried to share that same passion to undergrad students through teaching assistant. These were rewarding moments.
3. **Gravitas** - Acedemia teaches you how to be rigorous and methodical, especially when applying the scientific methodology. This seriousness is incredibly valuable in high stakes environments in the tech industry. It's also important to balance this rigidity by design with a lighter and playful process to avoid sternness. The results, them, need to be reaching the expected standards of quality and reliability. Balance is the key.

## TL;DR Papers Summary
- MSc Research = 🐹 🌱 ❄️
- Brown lemmings in the Canadian High Arctic don't reach large enough population sizes to deplete their resources and drive population declines.
- I studied the longest known wild female brown lemming. They were previously known to live less than a year in the wild but I became the lucky researcher (and maybe even the only one) who had the chance to capture her multiple times over a 3 years period. She was even pregnant at one point. It was a real privilege to be part of her life.
- Brown lemmings really like Arctic willow roots but in summer, they treat themselves with flowers and buds.
- BSc Honours = 🐢 🩸 🌊
- I sampled blood from 26 painted turtles in Ontario's freshwater lakes to find out mercury concentrations were not high enough to immunosuppress or cause parasitism in specific local populations.
